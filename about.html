        <p>
            I am a first generation college student from a small town in West
            Tennessee called Henderson. I first discovered my love for computers
            and technology at a young age, playing video games and using
            the family desktop (mostly for MS Paint). Growing up, my access to
            the internet was limited to my time at school, so almost the
            entirety of my computer knowledge comprised of self taught
            trial-and-error. I was fascinated by how computers were so
            prevelant in everyday life, and strived to learn as much as I could
            about them. <br/> 

            My fascination with computers culminated when I made the decision to
            pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of
            Tennessee, Knoxville. Prior to my first day of class, I had
            absolutely no experience programming. Since then, I have learned and
            used nearly a dozen computer languages, and many more
            technologies.<br/>

            I am currently a full time student, and am available for part time
            work. I plan to graduate May 2017, after which I will be available
            for a full time position.</br>

            The majority of my experience has been with the C language. C++ was
            the first language I learned in school, and have since learned and
            used Python, Java, Javascript, R, Perl, PHP, Go, and Lisp. I have 
            most enjoy working with Python, and indeed one of the largest
            projects I have yet worked on was written in Python.<br/>

            I enjoy web programming more than perhaps any other style of
            programming, as it mixes my love for programming with my love for
            art and design. I like the process of thinking through how to lay
            out elements in ways that make sense, and in ways that make people's
            lives easier.<br/>
